# The Number
## One Transparent Velocity Metric Per Person

Replace multiple KPIs with one number that captures velocity, creates transparency, and drives behavior.

---

## The Concept

**One number per person that measures the speed of value delivery‚Äînot activity completion.**

When everyone has twenty KPIs, nobody has real accountability. When success has a hundred definitions, failure has a thousand excuses.

**The Number** eliminates ambiguity. It's singular, visible, and impossible to fake.

---

## The Four Criteria for Your Number

### 1. Velocity-Focused
**It measures speed of value delivery, not activity completion.**

‚ùå **Bad:** Number of protocols written per quarter
‚úì **Good:** Days from protocol completion to first patient enrolled

---

### 2. Within Your Direct Control
**You can influence it through your daily decisions.**

‚ùå **Bad:** Overall market share (influenced by competitor actions)
‚úì **Good:** Your process cycle time (you own this completely)

---

### 3. Continuously Measurable
**Updates at least weekly, ideally daily.**

‚ùå **Bad:** Annual customer satisfaction survey results
‚úì **Good:** Daily throughput rate of your core process

---

### 4. Impossible to Game
**The only way to improve it is to actually improve.**

‚ùå **Bad:** Percentage of tasks completed on time (just do easy tasks first)
‚úì **Good:** Time from starting work to delivering customer value (can't fake speed)

---

## Pattern Recognition

**These numbers measure the physics of flow, not the theater of activity.**

They capture whether work moves faster through the system, not whether people appear busy.

---

## Anti-Patterns: What NOT to Measure

### The Scorecard Delusion

**Problem:** When you measure everything, you measure nothing that matters.

#### Real Example: 2,847 Metrics
A pharmaceutical company tracked 2,847 distinct metrics across clinical development:
- Dedicated analysts spent 40% of time updating dashboards
- Trials took 32% longer than industry average
- **Every scorecard metric was green**

**What they measured:**
- Weekly meetings held ‚úì (But were decisions made?)
- Standard operating procedures followed ‚úì (But did they add value?)
- Quality processes completed ‚úì (But did work flow faster?)
- Regulatory boxes checked ‚úì (But did patients benefit sooner?)

**Insight:** "When you can be green on every metric while losing every race, your measurement system is optimized for comfort, not truth."

---

### Multiple KPIs = No Accountability

When everyone has twenty KPIs, nobody has real accountability.

**The Number eliminates this entirely.**

---

## The Green/Yellow/Red System

### üü¢ Green: You're Improving Velocity Consistently
- Full autonomy granted
- No questions asked
- Resources available on request
- Keep doing whatever you're doing

### üü° Yellow: You've Plateaued or Inconsistent Improvement
- Support is available
- Coaching offered
- Resources accessible
- Additional training provided
- Still your decision how to improve

### üî¥ Red: You're Slowing the Organization or Declining Performance
- Intervention required
- Either fix it quickly, get intensive help, or get reassigned

---

### No Subjectivity

- No subjective performance reviews
- No political evaluations
- No manager interpretation of contribution
- **Your Number tells your story objectively**

**Result:** When everyone can see your Number, you don't need a manager to motivate improvement. You already know where you stand. And everyone else knows too.

**This creates peer accountability far more powerful than hierarchical pressure.**

## How Transparency Drives Behavior

### "What's Your Number?"
This becomes the universal greeting.

---

### The Transformation Arc

#### Initial Shock (Days 1-7)
- Transparency feels violent
- People who've hidden behind activity stand naked before results
- Resistance: "This is too much pressure!" "What about context?" "Numbers don't tell the whole story!"
- Comfortable ambiguity evaporates

#### Competitive Awakening (Weeks 2-4)
- Nobody wants the worst Number on their floor
- Conversations shift from defending current performance to seeking help
- Energizing competition emerges

#### Collaborative Evolution (Weeks 5-12)
- Teams stop hiding problems and start solving them together
- When everyone's Number is visible, helping others improve their Number improves yours
- Silos crumble because bottlenecks can't hide

#### Cultural Lock-in (Month 3+)
- New employees ask about their Number before asking about benefits
- Teams celebrate Number improvements like product launches
- Visibility becomes primary source of pride and motivation

---

## The Psychological Safety of Clarity

### Counterintuitive Insight:
**When everyone's Number is visible, people feel safer, not more exposed.**

---

### Why?

‚úì Clarity eliminates the anxiety of ambiguity
‚úì You know exactly where you stand
‚úì You know exactly what's expected
‚úì You know exactly when you're succeeding
‚úì No more wondering if your manager secretly thinks you're underperforming
‚úì No more political maneuvering to appear valuable
‚úì No more anxiety about surprise feedback

---

### Critical Requirement:
**Transparency without support is cruel.**

**Transparency with Development Support is the highest form of organizational care.**

The Number must be paired with:
- Resources to improve
- Coaching when needed
- Clear paths to success
- Removal of organizational barriers

## Common Questions

### "What if my role has multiple important deliverables?"

Pick the one that represents your primary bottleneck to velocity. If you have multiple, you lack focus.

### "What if my Number depends on other teams?"

Good. That makes collaboration essential. When everyone's Numbers are visible, helping others improves your own Number.

### "What about quality? Won't this encourage speed at the expense of quality?"

The Number measures **value delivery**, not just speed. If you deliver fast but break things, your Number won't improve‚Äîyou'll just be fixing problems repeatedly.

### "Isn't this too much pressure?"

Ambiguity is more stressful than clarity. The Number eliminates wondering where you stand. Pressure comes from uncertainty, not transparency.

---

## Success Criteria

- **Time from problem identification to resolution drops 90%**
- Employees actively surface problems knowing support will follow
- Your Number becomes your professional identity
- Improvement in your Number = improvement in organizational velocity

---

## Getting Started

### Week 1: Define Your Number
- Use worksheet to identify and validate
- Get manager alignment on definition
