# Rock Canvas
## 90-Day Transformation Sprint

Transform your biggest bottleneck into your competitive advantage in 90 days.

## What is a Rock?

A **Rock** is a focused 90-day sprint to eliminate your single biggest organizational bottleneck.

**Why 90 days?**
- Long enough for meaningful progress
- Short enough to maintain intensity
- Human psychology optimized for this timeframe

**Key principle:** One Rock, one owner, one outcome.

## Red Flags

### ðŸš© Rock Owner Changed Mid-Sprint
**This almost always means failure.** Rock ownership requires deep context and commitment. Changing owners resets the clock.

### ðŸš© Success Criteria Changed
**If the target moves, you're managing perception, not solving problems.** Lock success criteria at the start.

### ðŸš© No Measurable Progress for 2+ Weeks
**Lack of progress = blocked or wrong approach.** Escalate immediately for CEO intervention.

### ðŸš© Rock Owner Spending <25% Time
**If the Rock isn't worth 25% of the owner's time, it's not a real Rock.** Either free up the owner's time or choose a different Rock.

### ðŸš© Team Keeps Changing
**Rotating team members prevents momentum.** Lock the team for 90 days unless someone leaves the company.

### ðŸš© Scope Creep
**Adding objectives mid-sprint dilutes focus.** If new priorities emerge, finish this Rock first, then start a new one.

## Rock Identification Matrix

Rate potential Rocks on four criteria (1-10 scale):

| Criteria | Weight | Your Rock Score |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Universal Pain** - Does everyone suffer from this bottleneck? | 30% | _____ / 10 |
| **Contained Scope** - Clear process boundaries, not enterprise-wide? | 25% | _____ / 10 |
| **Measurable Impact** - Can we quantify the improvement? | 25% | _____ / 10 |
| **Catalytic Potential** - Will solving this unlock other improvements? | 20% | _____ / 10 |
| **TOTAL SCORE** | 100% | _____ / 10 |

**Scoring guide:**
- **8.0+** Ideal Rockâ€”clear impact, achievable scope
- **6.0-7.9** Good Rockâ€”consider prioritizing
- **<6.0** Too diffuse or low impactâ€”choose different constraint

## Example: Protocol Amendments Rock

### The Problem
Protocol amendments take 6-12 weeks, destroying trial momentum and delaying patient enrollment.

### The Physics
Sequential approvals through 14 systems create 41 days of waiting for 90 minutes of actual work:
- 127 discrete steps across 14 systems
- 23 approval signatures (only 3 required by regulation)
- 47 documents generated (most never read)
- 16 handoffs between departments
- 11 waiting periods built into the process
- 6 committees that review but never reject

**Reality:** We're not slow at protocol amendments. We're fast at protocol amendments. We're just world-class at waiting.

### The Outcome
**Current state:** 42-day average cycle time (portal to portal)
**Target state:** 48-hour protocol amendment turnaround (portal to portal)
**Measurement:** Days from amendment submission to final approval

**Success criteria:**
- [ ] 90% of amendments complete within 48 hours
- [ ] Only regulatory-required approvals remain
- [ ] Zero committee reviews for standard amendments
- [ ] Automated routing and documentation

### The Timeline
**Start:** January 8, 2025
**Target completion:** April 8, 2025 (90 days)

### The Rock Owner
**Name:** Sarah Chen, Clinical Operations Manager

**Why Sarah:**
âœ“ Deep frustrationâ€”built 3 workarounds in last year
âœ“ Knows every step of current process intimately
âœ“ Respected by sites, medical teams, and regulatory
âœ“ Willing to challenge sacred cows
âœ“ No empire to protect (came from external role)
âœ“ Successfully eliminated site activation delays last year
âœ“ Available 60% time for 90 days

### The Team
5 people selected by Sarah (not assigned by politics)

### The Resources
- **Budget:** $150,000 discretionary
- **Authority:** Up to $25K per purchase without approval
- **Time:** Sarah 60%, team members 30% each
- **External:** Can hire workflow automation consultant

### The Obstacles
1. **Medical review committee resistance** â†’ Mitigation: CEO announces regulatory analysis showing only 3 signatures required
2. **Legal department risk aversion** â†’ Mitigation: External regulatory counsel validates streamlined process
3. **Regulatory interpretation confusion** â†’ Mitigation: Direct FDA liaison established

### The Authority Package
- Direct line to CEO weekly
- Can eliminate any non-regulatory approval
- Can redesign workflows without IT approval
- Public CEO announcement of Rock with executive support
- Immunity from departmental pushback

## Success Metrics

**Does your Rock succeed if:**
- [ ] You hit your 90-day outcome (measurable target achieved)

- [ ] The solution is systematized (encoded into processes/systems)
- [ ] Other teams request your approach (catalytic impact)
- [ ] Your team wants to tackle another Rock immediately (momentum built)

**All 5 checkboxes = Rock success**
