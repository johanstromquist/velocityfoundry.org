# Alignment Pulse
## The 45-Minute Meeting That Replaces All Others

One focused weekly meeting that replaces ALL standing meetings.

---

## Meeting Structure

**Duration:** 45 minutes, once per week
**Attendees:** Leadership team with direct operational accountability
**Rule:** Hard stop at 45 minutes—no exceptions

---

## The Four-Part Protocol

### Minutes 0-5: Numbers (Not Commentary)

Each person **states** their Number. Period.

**NOT:**
- Explanations
- Justifications
- Contextualization
- Stories

**Examples of correct format:**
- "Site activation: 31 days, down from 34."
- "Data lock: 168 hours, up from 155."
- "Submission time: 22 days, flat from last week."

**Purpose:** Everyone knows instantly who's accelerating and who's creating friction.

---

### Minutes 5-15: Rocks (On Track/Off Track/Blocked)

**What are Rocks?** The 3-7 most important things that must get done in the next 90 days.

**Rock Definition:**
- 90-day timeframe (long enough for progress, short enough for intensity)
- Exactly ONE owner (not a committee)
- Clear, measurable outcome

**Format:** Each Rock owner gives a **ten-second update**:
- "Protocol simplification: On track, 60% complete, delivering Week 12."
- "Data platform migration: Blocked, need vendor selection decision by Friday."
- "Site network expansion: Off track, adjusting approach, new target Week 15."

**No:**
- Storytelling
- Excuses
- Details (unless specifically requested)

**Only question:** Will you hit your 90-day outcome?

### Minutes 15-40: Constraint Solving

**25 minutes of focused problem-solving** on the biggest organizational bottleneck.

Not discussion—**active constraint elimination**.

#### Four Key Questions:

1. **What's the actual constraint** slowing everything down?
2. **What would eliminate it permanently**, not just work around it?
3. **Who owns the solution** and what happens by next week?
4. **What resources are needed** to remove this friction?

This is organizational surgery: cut out the constraint, implement the solution, move on.

---

### Minutes 40-45: System Adjustments

**Only system-level decisions** that change how the organization operates.

#### Examples:
- "Increasing clinical team's budget authority to $50K for standard expenses"
- "Changing protocol approval from committee review to CMO direct approval"
- "Automating site payment processing effective Monday"

#### NOT operational decisions
Those flow automatically through established criteria.

**Focus:** Changes to how the organizational system operates.

## What NOT to Do in This Meeting

| ❌ Don't Do This | ✓ Do This Instead |
|------------------|-------------------|
| Status Updates | Use real-time dashboards |
| Information Sharing | Use documentation |
| Operational Approvals | Flow through pre-defined criteria |
| Brainstorming Sessions | Focused work sessions with specific outcomes |
| Relationship Building | Happens through collaborative work |

**Key principle:** "The Alignment Pulse is not a substitute for other meetings. It's the elimination of the need for other meetings."

---

## Success Criteria

- **Meeting hours decrease 90%**
- **Decision speed increases 300%**
- All coordination happens through systems, not meetings
- The pulse becomes the heartbeat, not the work itself

---

## Common Pitfalls

❌ **Using pulse for status updates** instead of constraint solving
✓ Status is visible on dashboards; pulse is for decision-making

❌ **Letting meetings run over 45 minutes**
✓ Hard stop trains discipline and forces prioritization

❌ **Allowing storytelling and explanations**
✓ Facts only—numbers, status, constraints

❌ **Skipping weeks because "nothing to report"**
✓ Consistency creates rhythm; always meet

## The Transformation

When you master the Alignment Pulse, you'll discover:

- The 45-minute pulse isn't the work
- It's the heartbeat that confirms the organism is healthy
- The real work happens in the spaces between beats
- Everyone stays aligned without living in meetings

**Result:** Your organization operates at velocity because coordination is systematic, not ceremonial.

## Before Your First Pulse

### Prepare:
1. Define each person's Number
2. Identify current 90-day Rocks with single owners
3. Set up real-time dashboard for Numbers
4. Communicate the new format to all participants
5. Schedule recurring 45-minute weekly slot

### First Meeting Focus:
- Practice stating Numbers without commentary
- Practice ten-second Rock updates
- Identify the single biggest constraint
- Make one system-level decision

**Remember:** The first few pulses will feel awkward. That's normal. Discipline creates the rhythm.

---

## 90-Day Target

All coordination happens through systems, not meetings. Your calendar shows:
- One 45-minute Alignment Pulse per week
- Focused work sessions with specific outcomes
- Almost no standing meetings

**Success looks like:** Empty calendars, full velocity, aligned execution.
