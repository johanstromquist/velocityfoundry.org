            <p>In late December 2025, Andrej Karpathy—OpenAI co-founder, former Tesla AI director, one of the most technically capable people on earth—posted something that caught the attention of the technology world:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I've never felt this much behind as a programmer. The profession is being dramatically refactored. I have a sense I could be 10x more powerful if I just properly string together what has become available over the last year, and a failure to claim the boost feels decidedly like a skill issue."
            </blockquote>

            <p>If that is the experience at the absolute frontier of AI capability, what does it mean for the rest of us?</p>

            <p>I believe we are watching a gap open in real time. A gap between organisations adapting to AI-augmented work and those that aren't. And unlike earlier phases of AI adoption, this gap is no longer growing at a steady, manageable pace.</p>

            <p>It is compounding.</p>

            <h2>The Data on Divergence</h2>

            <p>The evidence for this divergence is no longer anecdotal. It's showing up in large-scale surveys, economic research, and corporate earnings reports.</p>

            <p>PwC's 29th Annual Global CEO Survey, covering 4,454 CEOs across 95 countries, paints a stark picture. Only 12% of CEOs report that AI has delivered both cost savings and revenue gains. 56% report no significant financial benefit. 22% say AI has actually <em>increased</em> their costs.</p>

            <p>But here's the headline: <strong>it's not that AI doesn't work. It's the divergence.</strong></p>

            <p>The 12% achieving dual benefits are 2.6 times more likely to have embedded AI deeply across their products and services. Organisations with strong AI foundations are three times more likely to report meaningful financial returns. The companies getting it right are pulling away from those that aren't.</p>

            <p>BCG's research quantifies this even more sharply. Only 5% of firms globally are what BCG calls "future-built"—generating substantial value from AI. Another 35% are scaling. The remaining 60% are, in BCG's assessment, "reaping hardly any material value" despite substantial investment. The future-built 5% achieve five times the revenue increases and three times the cost reductions of the lagging majority.</p>

            <h2>The Inside/Outside Gap</h2>

            <p>Kevin Roose, the New York Times technology columnist, captured the experiential dimension in January 2026:</p>

            <blockquote>
                "I follow AI adoption pretty closely, and I have never seen such a yawning inside/outside gap. People in San Francisco are putting multi-agent Claude Swarms in charge of their lives, consulting chatbots before every decision... People elsewhere are still trying to get approval to use Copilot in Teams."
            </blockquote>

            <p>His observation resonated because it articulated something many people were sensing but hadn't named. The gap between AI early adopters and everyone else is no longer a gentle slope.</p>

            <p>It has become a cliff.</p>

            <p>For much of 2023 and 2024, the difference between early adopters and the mainstream was a matter of degree. Some people used AI more than others, but the basic understanding of what AI could do—answer questions, draft text, summarise documents—was broadly shared.</p>

            <p>Something changed in late 2025. The combination of new model capabilities, autonomous agents that execute multi-step work without supervision, and tools that put those capabilities in non-developers' hands created what feels like a phase shift. And because AI capabilities beget more advanced use cases, which beget more advantage, which widens the gap further, the divergence now compounds.</p>

            <p><strong>Linear growth in an exponential environment is a compounding disadvantage.</strong> That is the acceleration gap.</p>

            <h2>What Actually Changed</h2>

            <p>Most people's mental model of AI is still the chatbot: you ask a question, you get an answer. You paste in some text, the AI edits it. This is the Copilot/ChatGPT paradigm, and it is roughly where the majority of enterprises sit today.</p>

            <p>What emerged in late 2025 is something qualitatively different: <strong>AI as an autonomous agent</strong>. Rather than answering a question, an agent receives an objective and executes it end-to-end. It reads files, writes code, searches the web, creates documents, tests its own work, and iterates—all without real-time human oversight. Multiple agents can work in parallel. They can run while you sleep.</p>

            <p>This is not an incremental improvement on the chatbot. It is a category change. Thinking of AI as a chatbot is like thinking of electricity as "the thing that powers a lightbulb."</p>

            <p>Nathan Lambert, an AI researcher, captured the personal experience of this shift: "Since trying Claude Code with Opus 4.5, my work life has shifted closer to trying to adapt to a new way of working with agents. This new style of work feels like a larger shift than the era of learning to work with chat-based AI assistants."</p>

            <p>He describes the feeling of moving "from using the power tool to pointing the army."</p>

            <h2>The Professional Services Reckoning</h2>

            <p>For professional services firms—consulting, advisory, legal, regulatory—these dynamics converge into a direct challenge to the business model.</p>

            <p>The traditional model is built on a simple equation: value equals time multiplied by expertise. Clients pay for hours of senior people thinking about their problems. The entire commercial structure rests on this assumption.</p>

            <p>AI breaks the assumption. When a task that took a team of analysts two weeks can be accomplished by an agent in two hours, the hours-based pricing model does not merely come under pressure. It becomes indefensible. Not in theory, not eventually, but now.</p>

            <p>The data confirms this reckoning is already underway:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>73% of consulting clients now prefer pricing models tied to measurable business outcomes rather than time spent</li>
                <li>McKinsey's internal AI tools are saving consultants approximately 30% of their time on projects</li>
                <li>Projects that once took ten weeks can now be executed in six—a 30-40% reduction in cost base</li>
                <li>AI automates roughly 60% of analytical work in consulting engagements</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The largest firms are already restructuring. Deloitte announced in January 2026 that it is scrapping traditional job titles as AI reshapes its delivery model. BCG has grown from zero AI revenue to $2.7 billion annually. McKinsey expects 40% of its business to be AI-related in the near future.</p>

            <p>And the disruption isn't only coming from within the industry. OpenAI has launched a consulting division with a reported $10 million minimum engagement, embedding engineers directly with enterprise clients—cutting out traditional consulting intermediaries entirely.</p>

            <h2>The Asymmetry of Inaction</h2>

            <p>For any leader reading this, the temptation is to wait. To let the technology mature, the hype subside, the dust settle. To treat AI as a 2027 strategy problem rather than a 2026 operational one.</p>

            <p>I think this is precisely wrong. The costs of action and inaction are deeply asymmetric.</p>

            <p><strong>If you invest in AI transformation and AI turns out to be overhyped</strong>, you have spent time and money upskilling your people. They are more capable. You have modernised some processes. The cost is recoverable.</p>

            <p><strong>If you do not invest and AI turns out to be as transformative as the evidence suggests</strong>, you are structurally uncompetitive. Your pricing model is indefensible against AI-augmented competitors. Your best people leave for firms that give them better tools. You lose mandates you used to win. The cost is potentially existential.</p>

            <p>The acceleration gap is real. It is supported by data from PwC, BCG, McKinsey, the IMF, and the lived experience of thousands of professionals at the frontier. The gap compounds. And the window for moving from the wrong side to the right side narrows with every quarter that passes.</p>

            <h2>The Good News</h2>

            <p>The skills that matter most in the AI era—domain expertise, strategic judgment, the ability to recognise and frame the right problems—are precisely the skills that experienced professionals already have.</p>

            <p>The shift is not about replacing those skills. It is about redeploying them: away from the production of deliverables and toward the direction-setting and validation that only human expertise can provide.</p>

            <p>The question is not whether this shift is coming. It is whether we choose to lead it or be led by it.</p>
