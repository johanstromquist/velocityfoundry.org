            <p>Just the other day I saw that Anthropic has released some new tools for Claude that connect it to public life science data sources—making Claude smarter at biological and medical research. A colleague pointed me to the news. Thank you, Ingela.</p>

            <p>My first thought wasn't <em>cool, let's check it out</em>.</p>

            <p>It was <em>cool, I should be able to do that too</em>.</p>

            <h2>The MMAgent</h2>

            <p>I'm not sure I'm allowed to say this, but before Christmas the team at Metalmind—our boutique GenAI agency—had created the MMAgent: a lightweight framework for integrating agents into host applications.</p>

            <p>Since then they've built a proof of concept. A generalist agent that can be equipped with different skills. I loved the experience of working with it. Super easy to use, very helpful, and an incredibly cool use of tools.</p>

            <p>The greatest advantage of the MMAgent is the ease with which you can add new skills to it. So considering Anthropic's play, I figured—why not try to create similar tools for our agent?</p>

            <h2>Two Hours</h2>

            <p>It took two hours with Claude Code.</p>

            <p>Then I had the first seven connectors in place:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>PubMed</strong> — 35 million+ biomedical articles</li>
                <li><strong>bioRxiv + medRxiv</strong> — preprints from the life sciences</li>
                <li><strong>ChEMBL</strong> — 2.4 million+ bioactive molecules</li>
                <li><strong>UniProt</strong> — protein sequences and functional information</li>
                <li><strong>Open Targets</strong> — drug-target associations</li>
                <li><strong>Reactome</strong> — biological pathways</li>
                <li><strong>ClinicalTrials.gov</strong> — 500,000+ registered clinical trials</li>
            </ul>

            <p>It took another five minutes and the agent had written a desktop research piece on the current status of Trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer.</p>

            <p>Five minutes.</p>

            <h2>The Trajectory Problem</h2>

            <p>I wrote <em>The Velocity Framework</em> naive to the practical impact of agents on knowledge work, but very much prepared for the capabilities they offer.</p>

            <p>It is challenging to look at your current situation and try to draw out a trajectory of development. We're kind of forever stuck in a world where things are the way they are. And after the next change we shrug and still believe they are the way they are.</p>

            <p>Dragging out that trajectory from yesteryear's AI capabilities to where we are today is easy. But continuing to extend it meaningfully into the future is <em>incredibly</em> difficult.</p>

            <blockquote>
                I do believe that working with the latest the labs have to offer gives you a continual glimpse of the future and what is to come.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>The Auto-Coder Vision</h2>

            <p>When I wrote <em>The Velocity Framework</em> I was 100% convinced that knowledge workers will solve a large amount of their own day-to-day assignments using code.</p>

            <p>They will build solutions—or speak them into existence—to make the problem go away forever.</p>

            <p>What's left is going to be a new frontier of impossibilities. Things we never imagined we could do, simply because we couldn't, that we are now suddenly capable of.</p>

            <p>You want to build an agent? Ask your auto-coder.</p>

            <p>You want to build an immersive online role-playing game? Ask your auto-coder.</p>

            <p>You want to write a book? Ask your auto-coder.</p>

            <h2>What This Means for Biotechs</h2>

            <p>For biotechs this is good news.</p>

            <p>It's <em>only</em> good news, and not great, because we still have to change. We have to embrace the new opportunities. We have to learn. We have to experiment, fail, and be frustrated.</p>

            <p>Those who do this fast will be ahead, for sure.</p>

            <p>But more than that—they will be the ones making the greatest difference to the patients they are trying to serve.</p>
