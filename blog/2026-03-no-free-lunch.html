            </p>

            <p>Ask anyone what worries them most about artificial intelligence and work, and you will get, beneath whatever sophistication the answer is dressed in, the same question: <em>how will I earn my keep?</em></p>

            <p>It is the right question to ask first. Not because it is the deepest question -- it is not -- but because it is the one that blocks all the others. You cannot think seriously about purpose, community, or meaning while you are worried about rent. The material question is foundational. Until it is addressed, everything built above it is unstable.</p>

            <p>In <a href="2026-02-what-remains.html">What Remains</a>, I argued that the anxiety surrounding AI and human value is rooted in three false equations: work as purpose, value as scarcity, contribution as output. That essay deliberately left the material dimension underexplored. This one stays with it -- not because money is the most interesting dimension of a post-work society, but because it is the dimension on which all the others depend.</p>

            <h2>The Myth of Proportional Reward</h2>

            <p>The sustenance question assumes a prior question has been answered: that the current system distributes resources in rough proportion to contribution. If it does, then removing the contribution naturally removes the reward, and we have a problem to solve. If it does not -- if the proportionality was always an illusion -- then the problem is older and different than it appears.</p>

            <p>The proportionality is an illusion. It has always been an illusion. But it has been a useful one, and AI is making it impossible to maintain.</p>

            <p>In 2018, physicists Pluchino, Biondo, and Rapisarda published a study simulating the distribution of success across a population. Their agents were assigned talent on a normal distribution and then encountered random events over simulated careers. The result: the distribution of talent was Gaussian, but the distribution of wealth was Pareto. The most successful individuals were almost never the most talented. They were moderately talented people who had encountered the most fortunate accidents. Luck -- not effort, not skill -- was the primary variable that converted ordinary ability into extraordinary outcomes.</p>

            <p>Did the founders of any given AI startup "deserve" a unicorn valuation? They were smart. They worked hard. But thousands of equally smart, equally hardworking founders built similar products at slightly different moments -- and did not become billionaires. The difference is not merit. It is timing, positioning, and chance. The narrative of desert -- "he earned it" -- is applied after the fact to make a stochastic outcome feel like a logical one.</p>

            <p>There is a revealing asymmetry here. People are more accepting of windfall wealth -- lottery winners, inheritance recipients -- than of equivalent wealth accumulated through corporate leadership. The lottery winner makes no claim of desert. The executive's wealth carries an implicit assertion: <em>I deserve this and you do not.</em> It is not the money that people resent. It is the narrative.</p>

            <p>This matters because the entire architecture of resistance to redistribution rests on the desert narrative. If market outcomes are proportional to contribution, then redistribution is punishment. If market outcomes are substantially stochastic, then redistribution is something different: a correction for variance in a system that distributes rewards according to luck and then tells a story about merit to justify the result.</p>

            <h2>We Have Done This Before</h2>

            <p>The idea that a wealthy society might guarantee its citizens' basic material needs regardless of employment status is not new. It was the central project of twentieth-century social democracy.</p>

            <p>In Sweden, the <em>folkhemmet</em> -- the "People's Home" -- was built over half a century into arguably the most comprehensive welfare state in history. By the early 1970s: universal healthcare, universal education, active labour market retraining, public spending approaching 60% of GDP. Poverty was effectively eliminated. Britain pursued a parallel project with the NHS and the post-war welfare state. In the US, Johnson's Great Society reduced the poverty rate from 22% to 12% in a decade.</p>

            <p>These were not utopian experiments. They worked. And then they stalled. The reasons matter, because anyone proposing a new sustenance architecture is proposing a continuation of this work.</p>

            <p><strong>The funding was fragile.</strong> Welfare states were funded through payroll taxes on wages, which assumed full employment. When the oil shocks hit, revenue contracted precisely when demand expanded. If a wage-funded system could not survive the 1970s, it certainly cannot survive a structural decline in the wage share of economic output.</p>

            <p><strong>The delivery could be inhuman at scale.</strong> Sweden's Miljonprogrammet built a million homes in a decade. The housing shortage was eliminated. But the later phases produced vast concrete suburban estates that prioritised efficiency over community. Within a generation, these neighbourhoods became synonymous with social isolation and economic segregation -- monuments to what happens when sustenance is optimised for delivery rather than for living.</p>

            <p><strong>The capture mechanisms were politically lethal.</strong> Rudolf Meidner's proposal to redirect excess corporate profits to employee-controlled funds was economically coherent and politically catastrophic. Up to 100,000 people marched through Stockholm against it -- the largest demonstration in Swedish history. The lesson: capture that looks like expropriation will be fought ferociously, even when the alternative is economically unsustainable.</p>

            <p>Tony Judt offered a corrective to the narrative that these projects had failed: "We have been told that the past was one of failure, that it is time to move on. But what if the past was actually an era of remarkable achievement, and the present is the failure?" The welfare states did not fail at providing sustenance. They failed at sustaining the political conditions under which sustenance could be guaranteed. These are different problems.</p>

            <h2>The Concentration Problem</h2>

            <p>The classical defence of concentrated wealth has always had a practical argument: the wealthy create jobs. Capital funds enterprises, enterprises hire workers, workers earn wages, wages are spent. Henry Ford understood this when he paid assembly-line workers enough to buy the cars they built. The logic is circular and self-reinforcing -- as long as human labour is a necessary input.</p>

            <p>AI breaks the circle. If productive output can be generated with dramatically less human labour, then wages shrink while wealth concentrates in the hands of those who own the systems. The economist Thomas Piketty's central observation -- that returns to capital consistently outpace economic growth, producing mechanical concentration of wealth -- becomes not a slow historical tendency but an accelerating structural feature. The distribution mechanism that moved wealth from producers to consumers -- the wage -- weakens.</p>

            <p>The existing mechanisms for wealth capture -- income tax, capital gains tax, corporate tax -- were designed for an economy where value passed through human labour. You cannot fund public services from income tax when income is concentrated in capital returns and platform rents. The plumbing no longer connects supply to demand. The question is not <em>whether</em> to redesign the collection architecture but <em>how</em>.</p>

            <p>The word "redistribution" is politically charged because it implies taking from those who earned it. But if the correlation between effort and reward is as weak as the evidence suggests, then what is being redistributed is not earned income but accumulated variance. The framing shifts from punishment to system maintenance: the plumbing is broken, and fixing it is not theft.</p>

            <p>The greatest resistance will come from those who benefit most. But the counterargument is structural: if the consumption base erodes because wages no longer circulate wealth, the owners of productive capital will find themselves with extraordinary capacity to produce and a shrinking population able to afford the output. Ford's insight, inverted: if no one can afford the cars, it does not matter how efficiently they are made.</p>

            <h2>The Expanding Floor</h2>

            <p>There is a particular irony in how modern economies treat essential services. The internet began as a publicly funded research project and became the indispensable infrastructure of contemporary life -- and yet it is priced as a commodity. Electricity follows the same pattern. These services pass through a predictable lifecycle: luxury, convenience, widespread adoption, assumed necessity -- and yet the pricing model remains stuck at an earlier stage.</p>

            <p>The consequences become visible during supply shocks. During the European energy crisis of 2021-2023, electricity spot prices in southern Sweden reached five to eight times those in the north -- for identical electrons on the same grid. Low-income households were spending 8-12% of disposable income on electricity. In Germany, the lowest income quintile spent 12-15% on energy. Meanwhile, Equinor posted $74 billion in profit. The windfall profits were the mirror image of the energy poverty -- a direct transfer from the poorest consumers to the wealthiest producers.</p>

            <p>The policy responses were telling. Germany allocated EUR 100 billion for emergency price caps. Sweden spent billions in emergency subsidies. Every intervention implicitly conceded the same point: market pricing of essential utilities is not socially sustainable when supply is disrupted. The question is not whether governments will intervene -- they already do, every time there is a crisis -- but whether they will do so structurally or through panicked patches after the damage is done.</p>

            <p>AI changes the feasibility calculus. The 1960s-70s vision of universal public services was constrained by the labour costs of delivering them. But many of the service-delivery functions that were expensive -- administrative processing, care coordination, educational tutoring, routine legal guidance -- are precisely the functions that AI can perform at dramatically lower cost. The technology that threatens to displace workers also reduces the cost of providing the services those workers need.</p>

            <p>This reframes the sustenance question. The conventional UBI debate asks: can we give everyone enough money? But money is only one mechanism. A small cash transfer combined with publicly provisioned, AI-enhanced services in healthcare, education, legal assistance, and essential utilities may provide a higher effective standard of living than a larger cash transfer in a fully marketised environment. The cash component handles what must be purchased privately. The service component handles what can be delivered as infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The dignity dimension matters. Nobody feels stigmatised by driving on a public road or calling the fire brigade. Public services, when universal and competent, are experienced as infrastructure, not charity. Bo Rothstein's central finding from decades of comparative research: universal systems generate the social trust they depend on, while means-tested systems erode it. The Swedish welfare state, at its best, operated on the assumption that most people would contribute if given the means and opportunity -- and that the cost of the few who would not was lower than the cost of surveilling everyone.</p>

            <h2>The Foundation, Not the Building</h2>

            <p>Sustenance is necessary but not sufficient. Money in the bank does not give a person a reason to get up, a community to belong to, or an answer to the question of what their life is for. The material question is the foundation, not the building.</p>

            <p>But it is solvable. The resources exist. The precedents exist. The delivery mechanisms are becoming cheaper and more capable. What has been missing is not the means but the story -- a narrative that makes sustenance legible not as dependency, not as charity, but as the foundation on which a society of genuinely free people might be built.</p>

            <p>The old story -- you earn your keep, and your keep is proportional to your contribution -- was never accurate. It was useful, for a time, as an organising fiction. That time is ending. The question is not whether we will write a new story. It is whether we will write it deliberately, informed by both the achievements and the failures of those who tried before us -- or whether we will let it be written for us, by the same forces of concentration and chance that the old story was designed to obscure.</p>
