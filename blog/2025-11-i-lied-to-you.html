            <p>I lied to you.</p>

            <p>Not about the facts. Not about the physics. Not about the 95% waste choking your organization or the velocity advantage compounding every day you delay.</p>

            <p>Those were brutally, uncomfortably true.</p>

            <p>But I lied by omission.</p>

            <h2>The Deliberate Provocation</h2>

            <p>I wrote <em>The Velocity Framework</em> as if organizational transformation were purely mechanical—remove the friction, redesign the systems, eliminate the committees, and velocity emerges like water finding its level.</p>

            <p>I knew it wasn't that simple.</p>

            <p>I've been APMG Change Management Practitioner certified since long before most people started worrying about AI. I've led transformations in several organizations over 25 years. I know that every "organizational scar tissue" committee I told you to eliminate has a name attached to it. Someone's career. Someone's identity. Someone who stayed until 9 PM building that process because they thought they were protecting the company.</p>

            <p>I know that when you tell a director their function will be automated, they hear "you're worthless." When you tell a team their workflow will be redesigned, they hear "you've been doing it wrong." When you tell people to move faster, they hear "you haven't been working hard enough."</p>

            <p>So why did I write <em>The Velocity Framework</em> as if none of that mattered?</p>

            <p><strong>Because you needed to be angry first.</strong></p>

            <p>You needed to see the waste. You needed to feel the urgency. You needed to stop accepting "that's how we've always done it" as justification for organizational malpractice.</p>

            <p>Most management books start with empathy. They acknowledge how hard change is. They validate your concerns. They make you feel understood.</p>

            <p>Then nothing changes.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Because empathy without urgency becomes an excuse. "Change is hard" becomes "change can wait." "People need time" becomes "let's form a committee." "We need buy-in" becomes "let's do a six-month communication planning initiative while our competitors pull further ahead."
            </blockquote>

            <p>I've seen too many organizations die the death of a thousand empathetic delays.</p>

            <h2>Why This Book Exists</h2>

            <p>My new companion book, <em>On Change: A Velocity Framework Companion</em>, exists because transformation requires both physics and people.</p>

            <p>The physics are non-negotiable. If your drug development process takes 336 hours when it should take 90 minutes, that's a physics problem. No amount of change management makes slow fast. The systems must change.</p>

            <p>But people aren't neutrons. You can't just reconfigure them like you redesign a workflow.</p>

            <p>When you eliminate that 336-hour process, you're not just removing waste—you're changing how 15 people spend their days. Their expertise, their relationships, their sense of contribution. Some will feel liberated. Others will feel obsolete. Both reactions are valid. Both require response.</p>

            <p><em>The Velocity Framework</em> told you what to change. <em>On Change</em> tells you how to change it without leaving casualties or creating resistance that kills the transformation.</p>

            <h2>The Integration You Need</h2>

            <p>Most change management books assume you have time to move gradually, building consensus at every step and minimizing disruption above all else. They optimize for comfort over speed.</p>

            <p>You don't have that luxury.</p>

            <p>The compound math doesn't care about your change curve. Your competitors moving at 10x velocity don't pause while you run focus groups. The patients waiting for treatments don't grant extensions while you work through resistance.</p>

            <p>So this companion book isn't going to tell you to slow down. It's not going to suggest that urgent transformation is somehow less humane than gradual decline.</p>

            <p>Instead, it shows you how to move fast <em>and</em> bring people with you. How to be urgent <em>and</em> empathetic. How to demand excellence <em>and</em> support the transition. How to eliminate the obsolete <em>and</em> help people find new value.</p>

            <p>This is change management for people who understand that slow is no longer an option.</p>

            <h2>What You'll Find in On Change</h2>

            <p>The companion addresses the change management gaps that velocity transformation exposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why change management still matters</strong> even when you're moving at velocity speed, and what velocity-compatible change management actually looks like</li>
                <li><strong>How to read resistance properly</strong>—the difference between technical concerns that will save your transformation and political resistance that will kill it</li>
                <li><strong>The headcount reality</strong>—when AI and automation eliminate roles, how do you handle transitions with honesty, support, and dignity?</li>
                <li><strong>Building change coalitions in 72 hours</strong> instead of 72 days, with the specific frameworks that make coalition-building velocity-compatible</li>
                <li><strong>Surviving the messy middle</strong>—Day 45 when doubt peaks, momentum stalls, and leaders almost quit</li>
                <li><strong>Making velocity permanent</strong>—how to prevent the backslide that kills most transformations within 18 months</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The Promise</h2>

            <p>By integrating both books, you'll know how to:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Launch a velocity transformation that people support rather than sabotage</li>
                <li>Communicate urgency without creating panic</li>
                <li>Help people through identity transitions when their roles evolve or disappear</li>
                <li>Distinguish between resistance that needs addressing and resistance that needs overriding</li>
                <li>Maintain momentum through the inevitable valleys of change</li>
                <li>Create a culture where velocity becomes the norm, not the exception</li>
            </ul>

            <p>You'll still move fast. You'll still eliminate the 95% waste. You'll still redesign systems and automate processes and collapse timelines.</p>

            <p>But you'll do it in a way that brings people with you instead of leaving them behind.</p>

            <p>Not because it's nice. Because it works.</p>

            <blockquote>
                The fastest transformations aren't the ones that ignore people. They're the ones that engage people so effectively that human energy accelerates the physics rather than resisting it.
            </blockquote>

            <h2>How to Use These Books Together</h2>

            <p>Read <em>The Velocity Framework</em> first. Let it make you angry. Let it show you the waste. Let it create urgency.</p>

            <p>Then read <em>On Change</em> to channel that urgency into transformation that lasts.</p>

            <p>Use <em>The Velocity Framework</em> to design your systems. Use <em>On Change</em> to bring your people through the transition.</p>

            <p>Reference <em>The Velocity Framework</em> when you need to remember why you're doing this. Reference <em>On Change</em> when you need to remember who you're doing it with.</p>

            <p>Both questions matter. Both answers are required.</p>

            <p>Urgency without empathy creates casualties. Empathy without urgency creates stagnation.</p>

            <p>You need both books because transformation requires both forces.</p>

            <h2>The Choice</h2>

            <p>Right now, you have a choice.</p>

            <p>You can read urgency and empathy as incompatible demands. You can decide it's too hard to hold the tension. You can collapse into one extreme or the other—the cold efficiency expert or the conflict-averse leader who lets compassion paralyze action.</p>

            <p>Or you can integrate them.</p>

            <p>The leaders who achieve lasting transformation refuse the false choice. They see the waste and refuse to accept it, while seeing the people and refusing to discard them. They move with urgency while building coalitions. They demand results while providing support.</p>

            <p>Not because it's easy. But because it's the only path to transformation that actually lasts.</p>

            <p><em>The Velocity Framework</em> and <em>On Change</em> are available now. Together, they form a complete picture: your organization operates at 5% of potential, and the people maintaining that dysfunction are often doing their best within broken systems.</p>

            <p>Both are true. Both require action.</p>

            <p>The question isn't whether you can do both.</p>

            <p>It's whether you will.</p>
