            <p><em>On Change: A Velocity Framework Companion</em> is live today.</p>

            <p>I didn't plan to write this book. The Velocity Framework was supposed to be enough—diagnose the friction, fix the systems, accelerate delivery. But after writing it I kept feeling guilty, like something was missing. I've seen the same pattern repeat:</p>

            <p>Day 1-30: Momentum. Energy. Early wins.</p>

            <p>Day 45: Doubt. Resistance. The moment everything almost dies.</p>

            <p>Day 90: Either breakthrough velocity or quiet regression back to the old way.</p>

            <h2>Why This Book Had to Exist</h2>

            <p>I've watched brilliant transformation plans fail not because the systems were wrong, but because leaders didn't know how to bring people through the messy middle.</p>

            <p>I've seen executives choose between moving fast or being empathetic—as if urgency and humanity were opposites.</p>

            <p>I've watched Day 45 doubt kill transformations that would have worked if leaders had just pushed through one more week.</p>

            <p><strong>On Change</strong> is the book I wish had existed for every leader I've worked with who stood at Day 45, exhausted and uncertain, wondering if they should keep going.</p>

            <h2>What's Inside</h2>

            <p>This isn't theory. It's pattern recognition from hundreds of transformations:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Why resistance is information</strong> — How to read the four categories of resistance and respond to each correctly</li>
                <li><strong>The 72-hour coalition sprint</strong> — Build change protection before you need it, not after</li>
                <li><strong>Day 45 survival</strong> — What's normal, what's dangerous, and when to push vs. when to retreat</li>
                <li><strong>The sustainability gap</strong> — Why transformations that succeed at Day 90 still fail at Month 18</li>
                <li><strong>The compassionate revolutionary</strong> — How to hold urgency and empathy simultaneously without choosing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who This Is For</h2>

            <p>This book is for leaders who:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Are about to launch a transformation and want to avoid the Day 45 crash</li>
                <li>Are currently <em>at</em> Day 45 and questioning everything</li>
                <li>Have tried transformation before and watched it quietly fail after initial success</li>
                <li>Refuse to choose between moving fast and bringing people with them</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you've ever been told "you need to slow down for change management" or "you're being too soft on resistance," this book is for you.</p>

            <h2>What Made This Meaningful to Write</h2>

            <p>The Velocity Framework gives you the systems. <em>On Change</em> gives you the people strategy.</p>

            <p>But more than that—writing this forced me to articulate something I've believed for years but struggled to prove: <strong>You don't have to choose between speed and humanity.</strong></p>

            <p>The leaders who move fastest are often the most empathetic. They understand that resistance is information. They build coalitions in 72 hours instead of waiting six months. They know exactly when to push and when to retreat.</p>

            <p>They're not balancing urgency and empathy. They're integrating them.</p>

            <p>That's what I call the compassionate revolutionary—and that's what this book helps you become.</p>

            <h2>What Happens Next</h2>

            <p>The book is live on Amazon (Kindle and paperback). If you're leading transformation—or about to—this pairs with <em>The Velocity Framework</em> to give you both the systems and the people strategy.</p>

            <p>Read <em>The Velocity Framework</em> first if you're diagnosing friction and building your transformation plan.</p>

            <p>Read <em>On Change</em> first if you're already in motion and need to navigate the messy middle.</p>

            <p>Read both if you want the complete playbook.</p>

            <p>And if you're at Day 45 right now, doubting everything—read Chapter 6. You're not failing. You're exactly where you're supposed to be. Don't stop now.</p>
