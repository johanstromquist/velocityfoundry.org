            <p>Picture ancient Athens, late afternoon. Socrates has cornered Polemarchus, a wealthy arms merchant's son, in his own home. The young man had swagger—he thought he knew what justice was. "Justice," he declared confidently, "is giving each their due. Helping friends, harming enemies."</p>

            <p>Socrates smiled. This would be fun.</p>

            <p>"Tell me, Polemarchus, who is best at giving what's due to the sick?"<br>
            "A doctor."<br>
            "And at sea, who gives sailors their due?"<br>
            "A navigator."<br>
            "So justice is... an art? A skill? What does it produce?"</p>

            <p>Polemarchus shifted uncomfortably. "It helps friends and harms enemies."</p>

            <p>"Ah," Socrates pounced. "But doesn't medicine produce health regardless of friendship? Doesn't navigation produce safe passage for all aboard? These arts serve something beyond themselves. They have what we might call a telos—an external purpose."</p>

            <p>The trap was sprung. Polemarchus had been treating justice like it was about justice itself—being just for the sake of being just. But Socrates showed him that every true art, every real techne, serves something outside itself. Medicine doesn't exist to be more medical. It exists to produce health.</p>

            <p>By the end, Polemarchus was dizzy, his certainty shattered. He'd discovered he was asking entirely the wrong questions about justice.</p>

            <p>Twenty-four hundred years later, we're making Polemarchus's exact error—but about artificial intelligence.</p>

            <h2>The Question That Hypnotizes Us</h2>

            <p>Listen to any tech panel, boardroom discussion, or LinkedIn thread: "When will we achieve AGI?" "Will AI become conscious?" "Can it match human intelligence?"</p>

            <p>We're so mesmerized by this question that we miss what's actually happening: AI is already transforming drug discovery, rewriting how we coordinate global supply chains, and enabling forms of creativity we couldn't imagine five years ago.</p>

            <p>Yet the discourse fixates on whether AI will become "like us"—as if that were the measure of its value.</p>

            <h2>The Recursive Absurdity</h2>

            <p>Here's what Socrates would find particularly amusing: We've created the most powerful tools in human history, then immediately started judging them by whether they can judge themselves. We've built systems that can predict protein folding, and we're asking if they're "self-aware."</p>

            <p>It's like ancient sailors discovering celestial navigation, then spending all their time debating whether the stars themselves know where they're going.</p>

            <p>The AGI discourse has become what Plato warned against: an art obsessed with itself rather than what it produces. We debate AI's future consciousness while underutilizing its present capabilities.</p>

            <h2>A Live Business Example</h2>

            <p>The most valuable AI partnership in history is currently paralyzed by AGI discourse. Microsoft invested over $13 billion in OpenAI, but their contract contains a clause stating that Microsoft loses access to OpenAI's technology once AGI is achieved.</p>

            <p>This clause—which some Microsoft executives originally dismissed as "arbitrary and unenforceable"—has now triggered high-stakes renegotiations that are blocking OpenAI's restructuring plans. OpenAI executives have reportedly discussed declaring AGI by releasing an AI coding agent that exceeds human programmer capabilities, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella calls AGI milestones "nonsensical benchmark hacking."</p>

            <p>Think about the absurdity: The two companies reportedly agreed that AGI only exists when AI systems generate at least $100 billion in profits - turning a philosophical question about intelligence into an accounting exercise. Meanwhile, their actual AI tools are revolutionizing everything from drug discovery to software development.</p>

            <p>The dispute has gotten so contentious that Microsoft is reportedly restricted from developing AGI independently until 2030, and OpenAI is considering bringing an antitrust suit.</p>

            <p>Two of the world's most powerful tech companies, sitting on transformative technology, are locked in a legal battle over when a hypothetical future state of consciousness might theoretically emerge.</p>

            <p>This isn't strategy. It's the discourse eating itself. While they argue about whether AI has achieved human-level intelligence, we should be busy talking about the impact of this technology on society, on organisations and on real people.</p>

            <h2>The Pragmatic Reality Nobody Discusses</h2>

            <p>Even if AI development froze today—no new models, no new breakthroughs—we would need decades to fully explore and implement what's already possible. Current AI can:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Analyze patterns across millions of medical images</li>
                <li>Optimize logistics networks in real-time</li>
                <li>Generate and test hypotheses faster than entire research departments</li>
                <li>Personalize learning for every student simultaneously</li>
            </ul>

            <p>But the discourse doesn't celebrate this. It asks, anxiously, "But is it AGI yet?"</p>

            <h2>Plato's Test for Cutting Through Noise</h2>

            <p>When someone brings up AGI in your next strategy meeting, channel Socrates with one question: "What good does this discussion serve?"</p>

            <p>Not the AI itself—that serves many goods. But the discussion about whether it's "truly intelligent" or "approaching AGI"? What decision does that enable? What value does that create?</p>

            <p>If they can't answer without using the words "prepare," "future-proof," or "stay ahead," you've identified discourse for discourse's sake.</p>

            <h2>The Liberation in Refocusing</h2>

            <p>Here's what happens when you abandon the AGI obsession and focus on AI's actual telos (purpose beyond itself):</p>

            <p>Instead of asking "Is this AGI?" ask "What human problem does this solve?"<br>
            Instead of "Will AI replace us?" ask "What can we achieve together that neither could alone?"<br>
            Instead of "When will AI be conscious?" ask "What unconscious opportunities are we missing while we debate?"</p>

            <p>The tools are revolutionary. The discourse is a distraction. And somewhere, Socrates is laughing at us for confusing the two.</p>
