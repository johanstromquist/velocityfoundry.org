            <p>Two Rocks. Same organization. Same 90-day window. Both aimed at eliminating organizational friction.</p>

            <p>The first Rock Owner spent Day 1 crafting announcements. Day 2 building project plans. Day 3 broadcasting org-wide communications. By Day 7, fighting antibodies. By Day 30, defending the Rock's existence in steering committees. By Day 90, achieved 40% of goal—decent, but not breakthrough.</p>

            <p>The second Rock Owner spent Day 1 having coffee with five specific people. Day 2 connecting with three department heads. Day 3 grabbing fifteen minutes with the skeptical VP everyone feared. Day 7, when resistance emerged, three champions defended his work before he knew there was a problem. Day 30, when budget questions surfaced, a finance director he'd never met advocated for resources. Day 90, exceeded target by 30%.</p>

            <p>The difference wasn't execution capability or Rock quality or executive sponsorship.</p>

            <p><strong>It was building coalition before needing it.</strong></p>

            <h2>The Coalition Paradox</h2>

            <p>Velocity transformation demands speed. Change management demands stakeholder engagement. Traditional coalition building takes months. You have days.</p>

            <p>The answer isn't to skip coalition building. That's how Rocks fail.</p>

            <p>The answer isn't to slow down transformation for extensive buy-in. That's how organizations stay broken.</p>

            <p>The answer is to build coalitions differently—strategically, efficiently, and early enough to matter but fast enough to maintain velocity.</p>

            <h2>What Traditional Change Management Gets Right</h2>

            <p>Before we discard months-long stakeholder mapping, acknowledge what it solves:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Political Reality:</strong> Organizations are political systems. Ignore politics, get crushed by politics.</li>
                <li><strong>Information Asymmetry:</strong> The people doing the work know things executives don't.</li>
                <li><strong>Implementation Leverage:</strong> Three advocates at implementation level beat ten executives.</li>
                <li><strong>Resistance Intelligence:</strong> Early objections reveal real obstacles. Late objections reveal entrenched opposition.</li>
                <li><strong>Sustainability:</strong> Changes imposed survive until the imposer leaves. Changes co-created survive because they're owned.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>According to 2024 research tracking organizational change initiatives, transformations are <strong>four times more likely to succeed when influential employees are involved early</strong>. When employees are genuinely invested in change, success likelihood increases by 30%.</p>

            <p>Traditional change management takes six months because they're solving real problems. We're going to solve the same problems in 72 hours.</p>

            <h2>The Critical Mass Calculation</h2>

            <p>You don't need everyone on board. You need enough thrust to escape gravity.</p>

            <p><strong>Critical mass formula:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>3-5 people in Critical Coalition (sponsors who protect)</li>
                <li>5-8 people in Implementation Champions (builders who execute)</li>
                <li>1-2 people in Strategic Briefing (gatekeepers who approve)</li>
                <li>Neutralize 2-3 most vocal potential resistors</li>
            </ul>

            <p>That's 11-18 strategic relationships. Not 100. Not even 50.</p>

            <p>In a 500-person organization, you can build sufficient coalition with less than 4% of the population.</p>

            <p>Choose the right 4%.</p>

            <h2>The 72-Hour Sprint</h2>

            <p>You have 72 hours from Rock assignment to launch. Here's how it works.</p>

            <h3>Hour 0-4: Intelligence Gathering</h3>

            <p>Before talking to anyone, understand the landscape:</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Review Previous Attempts</strong> (30 minutes): Has anyone tried this before? Why did they fail? Who opposed?</li>
                <li><strong>Map the Power Structure</strong> (30 minutes): Who has authority over resources? Informal influence? Veto power?</li>
                <li><strong>Identify the Real Experts</strong> (30 minutes): Who actually does this work? Built the workarounds?</li>
                <li><strong>Assess the Political Climate</strong> (30 minutes): Active turf wars? Recent org changes? Budget pressures?</li>
            </ul>

            <p>This isn't analysis paralysis. This is reconnaissance before engagement.</p>

            <h3>Hour 4-24: The Critical Coalition Conversations</h3>

            <p><strong>The Expert Conversation</strong> (First)<br>
            Talk to the person who knows the problem best—usually not executives.</p>

            <p>Framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I'm about to tackle [problem]. You live this daily. What am I missing?"</li>
                <li>Listen more than talk (80/20 ratio)</li>
                <li>Ask: "If you could redesign this, what would you build?"</li>
                <li>Close: "Can I check designs with you before finalizing?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Outcome: Gain implementation intelligence, earn credibility, recruit champion.</p>

            <p><strong>The Gatekeeper Conversation</strong> (Second)<br>
            Talk to whoever controls resources or approvals you need.</p>

            <p>Framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I need your expertise to avoid a disaster."</li>
                <li>Ask about constraints: "What can I absolutely not mess up?"</li>
                <li>Request: "Can you tell me quickly if I'm about to violate something?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Outcome: Understand boundaries, prevent blockers.</p>

            <p><strong>The Skeptic Conversation</strong> (Third)<br>
            Talk to the person most likely to oppose.</p>

            <p>Framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"I heard you think [category of initiative] often fails. Help me understand why."</li>
                <li>Acknowledge valid concerns</li>
                <li>Ask: "What would make this different from previous failures?"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Outcome: Convert resistor to consultant, or at minimum establish respectful relationship.</p>

            <p><strong>The Sponsor Conversation</strong> (Fourth)<br>
            Talk to your executive sponsor.</p>

            <p>Framework:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Share what you learned from other conversations</li>
                <li>Identify political landmines discovered</li>
                <li>Request specific support: "I need you to handle [specific person/issue]"</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Outcome: Align sponsor understanding, secure political protection.</p>

            <h3>Hour 24-48: Network Building</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Create the Core Team</strong>: Invite 2-3 champions to join the Rock team. Include at least one expert from front lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Build Cross-Functional Links</strong>: Introduce experts to each other. Delegate specific research.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Resource Commitments</strong>: Get budget confirmation in writing. Confirm team member availability.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Hour 48-72: Strategic Positioning</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Pre-Wire Brief</strong>: Visit everyone who will be asked about the Rock. Give them context before questions arrive.</li>
                <li><strong>The Launch Announcement</strong>: Craft the Monday morning email that announces the Rock with clear problem, goal, timeline, team, and ask.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>By Monday morning, you've already built the coalition that makes it viable.</p>

            <h2>Real-World Evidence</h2>

            <p>Research from John Kotter's analysis of 100 organizations going through transformation revealed a consistent pattern: unsuccessful transitions almost always founder during the early phases, particularly when failing to establish a powerful guiding coalition.</p>

            <p>More recent data confirms this. According to 2024 research:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organizations with strong change management strategies experience <strong>264% greater revenue growth</strong> than those with weak change effectiveness</li>
                <li>Only 30% of transformational changes succeed without proper coalition building</li>
                <li>When six key drivers (including coalition building and stakeholder engagement) are effectively executed, success rates increase to 73%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I've seen this pattern repeatedly. A mid-size biotech attempting to streamline clinical trial amendments built extensive project documentation but minimal coalition. Result: 40% improvement after nine months of committee warfare.</p>

            <p>Same company, different Rock Owner, different approach: 72 hours of targeted coalition building with medical monitors, regulatory specialists, and site managers. Result: 67% reduction in amendment cycle time, completed in 90 days, scaled across six active trials.</p>

            <p>The difference? The second Rock Owner had champions positioned at every friction point before launch.</p>

            <h2>Maintaining Coalition Through Transformation</h2>

            <p>Building the initial coalition gets you to launch. Maintaining it gets you to Day 90.</p>

            <p>Coalition maintenance follows a natural rhythm:</p>

            <p><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Core team needs daily updates. Broader coalition gets weekly touchpoints. This intensity is deliberate—early days determine whether momentum builds or stalls.</p>

            <p><strong>Weeks 3-6:</strong> Core team moves to weekly updates focused on progress, obstacles, early wins. Broader coalition checks in biweekly. Patterns are visible. Success or struggle becomes evident.</p>

            <p><strong>Weeks 7-12:</strong> Bring everyone together weekly. Results are visible. Success stories multiply. Recognition matters. This is when transformation either becomes real or reveals itself as performance theater.</p>

            <h3>When Resistance Emerges</h3>

            <p>Despite coalition building, resistance will emerge. The difference is response speed.</p>

            <p>Your coalition enables rapid classification and routing:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is this a practical concern or political opposition?</li>
                <li>Practical concerns get addressed directly with evidence</li>
                <li>Political opposition escalates to sponsors</li>
                <li>New information gets incorporated with thanks</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Then your coalition activates automatically. Champions defend before you ask. Sponsors intervene at peer level. Experts provide evidence.</p>

            <p>Week three of a budget approval Rock, the Finance Director raises audit concerns. Without coalition, the Rock Owner defends alone and appears defensive. With coalition, the Audit Manager—recruited during the 72-hour sprint—responds within hours: "We reviewed the controls. They exceed requirements. Here's the documentation." Issue resolved in two hours instead of two weeks.</p>

            <h2>The Coalition Building Canvas</h2>

            <p>Before launch, honestly assess:</p>

            <p>☐ At least 3 Critical Coalition members secured (sponsors who will protect)<br>
            ☐ At least 5 Implementation Champions recruited (builders who will execute)<br>
            ☐ All high-power stakeholders at minimum neutral (won't block)<br>
            ☐ Key practical resistors have path to conversion (concerns addressed)<br>
            ☐ Political resistors have executive sponsor managing them (neutralized)<br>
            ☐ Core team formed and committed (execution capacity exists)</p>

            <p>If you can't check all six, don't launch Monday. Spend another 48 hours building coalition.</p>

            <p>A Rock with insufficient coalition doesn't fail at Day 90. It fails at Day 14 when antibodies kill it.</p>

            <h2>Why Coalition Building Matters</h2>

            <p>Kotter's analysis of 100 organizations established the pattern. More recent data confirms it. My own experience across dozens of companies validates it.</p>

            <p>Coalition building isn't optional. It's fundamental.</p>

            <p>But it doesn't require six months. It requires 72 focused hours with the right people having the right conversations.</p>

            <blockquote>
                Build your coalition before you need it. By the time you need it, it's too late.
            </blockquote>
